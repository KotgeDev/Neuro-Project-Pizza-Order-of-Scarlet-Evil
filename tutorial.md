<p>Controls: <br>
arrow keys to move <br>
shift to slow movement <br>
z to shoot <br>
x to launch an inuke6000 <br>
Basically just Touhou controls
</p>
<p>
Some things to note: 
You can use the inuke6000 as many times as you want, but it will cause a portion of the map to become covered in radiation every time you use it. 
You won't be able to fire while the inuke6000 is still exploading
The small heart is your hitbox
