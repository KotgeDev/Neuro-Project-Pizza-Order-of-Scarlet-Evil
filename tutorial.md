<p>Controls: <br>
arrow keys to move <br>
shift to slow movement <br>
z to shoot <br>
x to launch an inuke6000 <br>
Basically just Touhou controls
</p>
<p>
Some things to note: 
You can use the inuke6000 as many times as you want, but it will cause a portion of the map to become covered in radiation every time you use it.
